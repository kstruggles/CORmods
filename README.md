Enslave allows you to sell your decendants off for a profit instead of costing money like to original mod that allowed you to addopt your child out. You still have a penalty for reputation and prestege. I'm trying to figure out how to change parent's ChildIds instead of killing the child to avoid dead

OLD stands for Only Living Desendants, meaning it deletes any decendant who dies in childhood, without being married or having children. The credit goes 900% to the Devs of COR, who honestly wrote this.
