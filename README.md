# CORmods
Citizens of Rome Mods

Enslave allows you to sell your decendants off for a profit instead of costing money like to original mod that allowed you to addopt your child out. You still have a penalty for reputation and prestege.

OLD stands for Only Living Desendants, meaning it deletes any decendant who dies in childhood, without being married or having children. The credit goes 900% to the Devs of COR, who honestly wrote this.

Enslave is based on both the "Give For Adoption" and OLD mods. I combinationed them while checking with the more complicated Divorce mod to ensure the structures are good. so Again, the Devs of COR deserve a large credit for it.

Current WIP:
mode to ask if you want to adopt a child or children whose parents have fallen on hard times.
