# CORmods
Citizens of Rome Mods

Enslave 
allows you to sell your decendants off for a profit instead of costing money like to original mod that allowed you to addopt your child out. You still have a penalty for reputation and prestege.
Enslave is based on both the "Give For Adoption" and OLD mods. I combinationed them while checking with the more complicated Divorce mod to ensure the structures are good. so Again, the Devs of COR deserve a large credit for it.


OLD
stands for Only Living Desendants, meaning it deletes any decendant who dies in childhood, without being married or having children. The credit goes 900% to the Devs of COR, who honestly wrote this.

Generate Decentants
it checks if your family is headed by a man or woman, and adds the icon to your or your children based on this. Also removed the requirement for you to be married for the icon to appear. I also ensured that if your heir is not the same gender as you they can also adopt children. I had made it so the children born were boys, but removed that. To add it back in, you can open the file in a text editor and add isMale: true, (or false for daughters) to the generate character spots (there are 4). changed the text a bit. You can also change the age up or down by changing age >= 16 to what every you desire (that's equal to or greater then). prior mod had the age at 18. I considered making it 30, but decided against it. also buffed the prestige and influence, but didn't decrease the cost. (I'm aware of the spelling mistake, but it's a non-impacting issue)

Menses
it ensures any married woman in your family becomes pregnant more frequently. It also gives your unmarried daughters a slight chance to become pregnant. I've ensured that any unwed daughter's child from this stays with her, rather then disappearing. 
Mense_yearly runs the same script without the math. causing every woman over 14 and under 40 to get pregnant if they aren't already. 

Transgender
Automatically gives all characters a chance to have their gender change and become gay (gay to reduce fertility because of parts not matching for creating pregnancy. My mense mod doesn't use fertility to cause pregnancy btw)

Message works
a document that allows you to test your first statements and possibly last statements by a triggerable icon. You would need to add it to an existing mod folder, as it's only the equivilent to the main.js page for mods. It's purpose is to make it easier for developers to troubleshoot their mods in pieces.

In progress
Trans_text, alternate version of transgender where it spawns a pop up to let you know when a kid/descendant transitions

Current Mod Ideas:
feel free to do these if you want
a 2 more mods to ask if you want to adopt a child or children whose parents have fallen on hard times. 1 expands on the current mod tightening who can adopt but still as a button you can press. So you can chose to initiate it. The other as a random event
a mod that allows you to make the game easier
 a mod to increase the number of lgbtq people in the family
