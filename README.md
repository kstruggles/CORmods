# CORmods
Citizens of Rome Mods

Enslave allows you to sell your decendants off for a profit instead of costing money like to original mod that allowed you to addopt your child out. You still have a penalty for reputation and prestege.

OLD stands for Only Living Desendants, meaning it deletes any decendant who dies in childhood, without being married or having children. The credit goes 900% to the Devs of COR, who honestly wrote this.

Enslave is based on both the "Give For Adoption" and OLD mods. I combinationed them while checking with the more complicated Divorce mod to ensure the structures are good. so Again, the Devs of COR deserve a large credit for it.

Current WIP:
mode to ask if you want to adopt a child or children whose parents have fallen on hard times.

Message works is a document that allows you to test your first statements and possibly last statements by a triggerable icon. You would need to add it to an existing mod folder, as it's only the equivilent to the main.js page for mods. It's purpose is to make it easier for developers to troubleshoot their mods in pieces.
