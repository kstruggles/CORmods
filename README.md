Enslave 
allows you to sell your decendants off for a profit instead of costing money like to original mod that allowed you to addopt your child out. You still have a penalty for reputation and prestege.
Enslave is based on both the "Give For Adoption" and OLD mods. I combinationed them while checking with the more complicated Divorce mod to ensure the structures are good. so Again, the Devs of COR deserve a large credit for it.


OLD
stands for Only Living Desendants, meaning it deletes any decendant who dies in childhood, without being married or having children. The credit goes 900% to the Devs of COR, who honestly wrote this.

Generate Decentants
As the title implies the mod allows you to generate decendants. this is a base mod to make it easier to get kids when you are having trouble getting your own. the only information generated is what's needed to get them to show up in the game. Stats, etc, are random. to reduce the number of buttons on screen and coding needed, it only works for men right now. will update it asap with one that includes both (currrently, if you open the file and change isMale to !isMale and swap where character information on mother and father are you can do it yourself) 

Current Mod Ideas:
feel free to do these if you want
a 2 more mods to ask if you want to adopt a child or children whose parents have fallen on hard times. 1 expands on the current mod tightening who can adopt but still as a button you can press. So you can chose to initiate it. The other as a random event
a mod that allows you to make the game easier
a mod that makes your unmarried daughters randomly become pregnant.

Message works is a document that allows you to test your first statements and possibly last statements by a triggerable icon. You would need to add it to an existing mod folder, as it's only the equivilent to the main.js page for mods. It's purpose is to make it easier for developers to troubleshoot their mods in pieces.
